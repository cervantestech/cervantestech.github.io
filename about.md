# About

I am a passionate senior cybersecurity professional with a proven track record of working with multinational corporations such as **Telefónica, IBM, Accenture, Orange, and Repsol**. Over the course of my career, I have assisted companies from various industries, including banking, retail, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and oil & gas, in improving their cybersecurity posture. I have achieved this by defining secure architectures for prevention and utilizing my experience to detect and solve security issues.
Currently, I am focused on managing cybersecurity in fintech at **Fintonic**, one of the largest startups in Spain. This role presents a significant challenge, but I am excited to tackle it head-on.

On the technical side, I specialize in bringing security to Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), designing authentication and authorization software architectures, and managing cybersecurity in complex multi-cloud environments, including container-based systems, with a focus on cloud-native security technology.

In addition to my technical expertise, I possess strong communication and leadership skills, allowing me to effectively communicate cybersecurity issues to C-level executives and developers alike. I am experienced in compliance and management, ensuring that all stakeholders are informed and up-to-date.

I am honored to have been recognized as one of the [**TOP50 CISOs to watch in 2023 worldwide**](https://www.lacework.com/blog/50-cisos-to-watch/) by the cybersecurity company, **Lacework**.

In conclusion, I am passionate about my work in cybersecurity and am always eager to learn and grow in this ever-changing field.
